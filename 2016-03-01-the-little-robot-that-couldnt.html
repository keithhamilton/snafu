    <div id='body-text'>
      <span class='pull-quote'>It all started with a simple idea about a robot that couldn’t.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot, in its most basic form, is a robot that needs help to do nearly
      everything in the physical world. Armed with a very narrow grasp of social
      psychology, and a few tricks up its shell, Needybot will literally be
      placed into the social world of Wieden+Kennedy’s Portland office, home to
      more than 600 people. It’s goal is simple: get help with stuff, and don’t
      die.
      <br/><br/>
      Depending on who you ask, however, Needybot has come to represent many
      things: an art project, a kind of robotic toddler, a performance art
      piece, a buddy, a pain in the ass. 
      <br/><br/>
      One of the most interesting outcomes of letting Needybot run around our
      office for the next nine months will be learning what it means to everyone
      else.
      <br/><br/>
      + + +
      <br/><br/>
      Nine months ago we didn’t have any clue what we were getting into. At that
      time, back in June 2015, only one member of our team had had any robotics
      experience, which meant the other 25 of us were walking blindly into what
      has since become one of the most challenging, educational, and fulfilling
      projects we’ve worked on in the Lodge.
      <br/><br/>
      When we didn’t have the technology, we found it. When we didn’t have the
      skills, we learned, rapidly.
      <br/><br/>
      But Needybot is more than just the first robotics project we’ve run at—it
      is, without contest, the largest-scale exploration into human-computer
      interaction (HCI) that The Lodge has ever undertaken. In fact, this is
      quite possibly the largest-scale exploration into HCI any advertising
      agency has ever undertaken.
      <br/><br/>
      Ours has been a road of confusion and frustration, then triumph and
      pride—we failed, repeatedly, blew the scope (and the team) far out of
      proportion, and rebooted the project (and the team) more than once.
      <br/><br/>
      In between all of this, we kept learning and adapting, and found enough
      small successes to keep the project ever aimed at its north star. Failure
      is not an end, but a beginning.
      <br/><br/>
      The pace and scale at which we have had to learn in order to produce
      Needybot has been massive for both our engineering and design teams. You
      may not think so, but the litany of subjects and skills required to build,
      shape, and create a fairly useless robot is exhausting.
      <br/><br/>
      Simply listing the subjects one can recall at will makes a strong case
      that Needybot represents a sum of information, knowledge, and craft unlike
      any other kind of project The Lodge has ever seen:
      <br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer vision</li>
        <li>3D-modeling & printing</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Sound engineering</li>
        <li>Interface and interaction design</li>
        <li>Mapping and localization</li>
        <li>Illustration</li>
        <li>Systems programming</li>
        <li>Machine learning</li>
        <li>Copywriting</li>
        <li>Structural engineering</li>
        <li>Data science</li>
        <li>Costume fabrication</li>
        <li>Protocol, upon protocol, upon protocol, upon…</li>
      </ul>
      <br/><br/>
      It is a point of pride for The Lodge to be able to say that, apart from
      the robotics hardware and software platform, we fabricated Needybot 100%
      in-house. When we didn’t have the technology, we found it. When we didn’t
      have the skills, we learned, rapidly. Ignorance is not a boundary, but a
      hurdle. 
      <br/><br/>
      <span class='pull-quote'>We are very sure about one thing, however: Needybot is a kind robot that
      no one has ever seen before.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot is being launched on a nine-month arc that will see it face new
      challenges as it integrates with the culture in our office building. Its
      goals and attitude will definitely hinge upon how the human element of our
      agency receives and treats it. Although Needybot was created by The Lodge,
      Needybot itself, along with the people of this agency will be largely
      responsible for its development as a robot.
      <br/><br/>
      It is somewhat fitting that it was nearly 40 weeks ago that we started
      this crazy project, because, to some of us, Needybot has become a sort of
      offspring. When we see a face light up during an interaction with Needy,
      we all feel warm inside. We trade high-fives in the background because we
      are proud of what we’ve created. We are Needybot’s parents.
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot is a labor of love that couldn’t have happened without countless
      hours of work on the part of many, many talented individuals. Given the
      spectrum of talent in The Lodge, combined with the cultural background of
      Wieden+Kennedy, it is arguable that Needybot couldn’t have happened
      anywhere else.
      <br/><br/>
      + + +
      <br/><br/>
      What will happen to Needybot in the coming months? What will it learn
      about the people at Wieden+Kennedy? What will we learn? Will someone
      drop-kick Needybot down the stairs? 
      <br/><br/>
      We don’t really know the answers to these questions. Well we have some
      idea, but, then again, we have been gloriously wrong before. We are very
      sure about one thing, however: Needybot is a kind robot that no one has
      ever seen before.
      <br/><br/>
      + + +
      <br/><br/>
      Stay tuned as Needybot’s adventure unfolds, and we learn more about robots
      and people, here in Portland.

      In fact, I never realized it until just today, but after having lived in

        ground to attack the burnt-out husk of a shitty house that used to be

      <span class='pull-quote'>Leash Your Cat.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      I live in urban Portland, and I want to talk briefly about a really shitty
      part about living in an urban environment.
      <br/><br/>
      My wife and I have a dog. We moved into our neighborhood almost six years
      ago, and immediately had to build a fence around the yard, so that our dog
      wouldn't be able to run willy-nilly around the 'hood. This is a given—no
      one, us included, would even take a second-thought at this.
      <br/><br/>
      So, Bailey, our half-sized, perpetually shagrinned, loving dog, is
      confined to the house or the yard, or she is on a leash. In short, she is
      a prisoner, but one we take very good care of and love very much.
      <br/><br/>
      I understand that some people aren't dog people. That's fine; it is, in
      part, the reason for having fences (apart from the obvious problem that
      dogs have big mouths, full of pointy teeth, and can bite fairly hard).
      True story: on the third day of living in our house, our next-door
      neighbor wrote and deposited a letter in our mailbox, informing us of our
      dog's ill behavior of barking incessantly. He threatened us with legal
      action if we didn't rectify the barking situation immediately.
      <br/><br/>
      Frustrated, but ultimately on the wrong side of the law, we decided to
      install a dog door, so that Bailey could go outside to evacuate, but could
      remain inside. As we had hoped, our house proved to be sufficient in
      deadening her barking that we received no further complaints.
      <br/><br/>
      The point I'm trying to emphasize here is that, as dog owners, we are
      implictly responsible to our neighbors. We have a duty and an obligation
      to ensure that our dog doesn't pollute their air space with her barking,
      doesn't pollute their yards with her poop, and is properly fenced in lest
      she run out and bite someone.
      <br/><br/>
      And now we've come to it. My dog is not the point of this post. Your cat
      is.
      <br/><br/>
      Sure. Cats are funny. Cats are cute, sometimes. GIFs of cats are
      especially great. The problem is, however, cats are much more of a
      nuisance than they are a benefit to urban society. To be clear, I'm
      speaking of "outdoor" cats.
      <br/><br/>
      As a dog owner, I have an implicit responsibility to my neighborhood. Not
      so for cat owners, whose wards tend to spend as much time shitting in my
      garden and destroying my plants as they do in their owners yards.
      <br/><br/>
      <span class='pull-quote'>Point blank, it is fucking disgusting to have to dig your cats' shit out
      of our garden beds. In fact, it's hard to believe it's even legal for you
      to have a cat in the city.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they shit in their owners' houses,
      apartments, duplexes, and condos. Outdoor cats shit in my yard.
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they chew up their owners' house plants,
      which their owners are responsible for replacing. Outdoor cats chew up my
      fucking garden plants, and I am responsible for replacing them.
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they kill nothing, save the catnip rodent
      toy they love to hunt after and murder, each day, endlessly, like some
      kind of Matrix-come-to-life. Outdoor cats kill animals and leave them in
      my yard, as if in some kind of tribute to my generosity for letting them
      hunt my land.
      <br/><br/>
      The bottom line here is that if you own a cat, and let it roam the
      outdoors in an urban environment, you are being a dick. Straight up. You
      are not taking responsiblity for an animal that doesn't give a turd for
      its actions, and will take what it wants, from whom it wants, and will
      shit on that person after the fact.
      <br/><br/>
      If I haven't been clear thus far, let me be so: I don't hate cats. I just
      hate your cats, in my yard. But, because it's a cat and not a dog, it gets
      some sort of societal pass to do whatever the fuck it pleases.
      <br/><br/>
      If you own an outdoor cat, do yourself a favor, and go ask your neighbors
      how it pleases them to pick up cat poop from their yards. Ask them how
      many plants they've had to replace. Ask them what they did with the dead
      rodents found in their yard, adorning the Japanese Maple to which they so
      lovingly tend.
      <br/><br/>
      Ask them that, then ask yourself if your cat shouldn't be wearing a shock
      collar that strongly encourages it to not leave your yard.
      <br/><br/>
      I take care of my pet, and I protect her from doing stupid shit around the
      neighborhood. It's high time cat owners do the same.
