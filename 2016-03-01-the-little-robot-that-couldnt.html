      <span class='pull-quote'>It all started with a simple idea about a robot that couldn't.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot, in its most basic form, is a robot that needs help to do nearly
      everything in the physical world. Armed with a very narrow grasp of social
      psychology, and a few tricks up its shell, Needybot will literally be
      placed into the social world of Wieden+Kennedy's Portland office, home to
      more than 600 people. It's goal is simple: get help with stuff, and don't
      die.
      <br/><br/>
      Depending on who you ask, however, Needybot has come to represent many
      things: an art project, a kind of robotic toddler, a performance art
      piece, a buddy, a pain in the ass.
      <br/><br/>
      One of the most interesting outcomes of letting Needybot run around our
      office for the next nine months will be learning what it means to everyone
      else.
      <br/><br/>

      <br/><br/>
      Nine months ago we didn't have any clue what we were getting into. At that
      time, back in June 2015, only one member of our team had had any robotics
      experience, which meant the other 25 of us were walking blindly into what
      has since become one of the most challenging, educational, and fulfilling
      projects we've worked on in the Lodge.
      <br/><br/>
      When we didn't have the technology, we found it. When we didn't have the
      skills, we learned, rapidly.
      <br/><br/>
      But Needybot is more than just the first robotics project we've run at&mdash;it
      is, without contest, the largest-scale exploration into human-computer
      interaction (HCI) that The Lodge has ever undertaken. In fact, this is
      quite possibly the largest-scale exploration into HCI any advertising
      agency has ever undertaken.
      <br/><br/>
      Ours has been a road of confusion and frustration, then triumph and
      prideâ€”we failed, repeatedly, blew the scope (and the team) far out of
      proportion, and rebooted the project (and the team) more than once.
      <br/><br/>
      In between all of this, we kept learning and adapting, and found enough
      small successes to keep the project ever aimed at its north star. Failure
      is not an end, but a beginning.
      <br/><br/>
      The pace and scale at which we have had to learn in order to produce
      Needybot has been massive for both our engineering and design teams. You
      may not think so, but the litany of subjects and skills required to build,
      shape, and create a fairly useless robot is exhausting.
      <br/><br/>
      Simply listing the subjects one can recall at will makes a strong case
      that Needybot represents a sum of information, knowledge, and craft unlike
      any other kind of project The Lodge has ever seen:
      <br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer vision</li>
        <li>3D-modeling & printing</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Sound engineering</li>
        <li>Interface and interaction design</li>
        <li>Mapping and localization</li>
        <li>Illustration</li>
        <li>Systems programming</li>
        <li>Machine learning</li>
        <li>Copywriting</li>
        <li>Structural engineering</li>
        <li>Data science</li>
        <li>Costume fabrication</li>
        <li>Protocol, upon protocol, upon protocol, upon&#8230;</li>
      </ul>
      <br/><br/>
      It <i>is</i> a point of pride for The Lodge to be able to say that, apart from
      the robotics hardware and software platform, we fabricated Needybot 100%
      in-house. When we didn't have the technology, we found it. When we didn't
      have the skills, we learned, rapidly. Ignorance is not a boundary, but a
      hurdle.
      <br/><br/>
      <span class='pull-quote'>We are very sure about one thing, however: Needybot is a kind robot that
      no one has ever seen before.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot is being launched on a nine-month arc that will see it face new
      challenges as it integrates with the culture in our office building. Its
      goals and attitude will definitely hinge upon how the human element of our
      agency receives and treats it. Although Needybot was created by The Lodge,
      Needybot itself, along with the people of this agency will be largely
      responsible for its development as a robot.
      <br/><br/>
      It is somewhat fitting that it was nearly 40 weeks ago that we started
      this crazy project, because, to some of us, Needybot has become a sort of
      offspring. When we see a face light up during an interaction with Needy,
      we all feel warm inside. We trade high-fives in the background because we
      are proud of what we've created. We are Needybot's parents.
      <br/><br/>
      Needybot is a labor of love that couldn't have happened without countless
      hours of work on the part of many, many talented individuals. Given the
      spectrum of talent in The Lodge, combined with the cultural background of
      Wieden+Kennedy, it is arguable that Needybot couldn't have happened
      anywhere else.
      <br/><br/>
      + + +
      <br/><br/>
      What will happen to Needybot in the coming months? What will it learn
      about the people at Wieden+Kennedy? What will we learn? Will someone
      drop-kick Needybot down the stairs?
      <br/><br/>
      We don't really know the answers to these questions. Well we have some
      idea, but, then again, we have been gloriously wrong before. We are very
      sure about one thing, however: Needybot is a kind robot that no one has
      ever seen before.
      <br/><br/>

      Stay tuned as Needybot's adventure unfolds, and we learn more about robots
      and people, here in Portland.
