      A short man, Southeast Asian&#8230;Cambodian?
      <br/><br/>
      I see him in passing every seventh time I walk from my bus stop to my
      office in the morning.
      <br/><br/>      
      His balding hair slicked back like fresh tarmac, nearly impervious to
      light. It seems to absorb warmth which I can only assume feeds his aura.
      <br/><br/>      
      His protruding, nearly bug-like eyes dart left, then right, then left.
      <br/><br/>      
      Right again. I get the sense he is watching for something, or someone.
      <br/><br/>      
      His right hand is kept, invariably, in his coat pocket; his left clutches
      the remains of a filtered cigarette to which he clings like some sort of
      sickly life raft. He takes approximately two puffs that I can see each
      time we pass.
      <br/><br/>      
      He walks purposefully, as if in a slight hurry to arrive at his
      destination, but not rushing too much.
      <br/><br/>
      <span class='pull-quote'>He appears, by all estimation, to be a man who knows his way around a pair
      of pliers and a blowtorch with deft efficiency.</span>
      <br/><br/>      
      I feel as if I know him somehow, although my conscious mind knows this to
      be impossible.
