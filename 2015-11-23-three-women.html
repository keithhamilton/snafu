      One, wearing green, her eyes a deep chestnut. Regarding them causes me to
      fall into a state of inebriation, in which time is a discarded napkin,
      detritus, substance I no longer consider relevant. She is calm, observing
      me as I observe her, exposing her fruit-bearing genitalia to me as they
      are open to the world.
      <br/><br/>
      A second, holding me in her gaze, cooked in bright orange. When the light
      changes, however, new tones present themselves, unabashedly: hints of
      peach and the kind of pink you would only ever see at dawn peek out from
      her cloak of radiant warmth. This, in a frigid environment.
      She shimmies left, then right, then left again in a repeating pattern.
      Something more than natural guides her movement, yet, she appears to be at
      once completely governed by the natural.
      <br/><br/>
      The last is bare; she has no further need for the clothing which has
      announced her likeness for the duration of this dance. She stirs
      irregularly if at all — she is evidently finished with our dance, awaiting
      the beginning of the next sonnet. Having given all she can, she now
      lingers in the twilight of our mutual engagement, patiently beckoning me
      come see her again, when life begins anew.
