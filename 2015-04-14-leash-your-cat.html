      <i style='font-size: 18pt'>Originally published when I still lived in N. Portland, I came across
        this a few days ago and thought it deserved re-publication.
        <br/><br/>
      In fact, I never realized it until just today, but after having lived in
        a new community for the past five months, behind the guns, gangs, and
        meth-addicted raiders who so graciously used my backyard as a staging
        ground to attack the burnt-out husk of a shitty house that used to be
        next door to ours, cats are the fucking nuisance I miss the least.
        <br/><br/>
        Anyway, enjoy.

      I live in urban Portland, and I want to talk briefly about a really shitty
      part about living in an urban environment.
      <br/><br/>
      My wife and I have a dog. We moved into our neighborhood almost six years
      ago, and immediately had to build a fence around the yard, so that our dog
      wouldn't be able to run willy-nilly around the 'hood. This is a givenâ€”no
      one, us included, would even take a second-thought at this.
      <br/><br/>
      So, Bailey, our half-sized, perpetually shagrinned, loving dog, is
      confined to the house or the yard, or she is on a leash. In short, she is
      a prisoner, but one we take very good care of and love very much.
      <br/><br/>
      I understand that some people aren't dog people. That's fine; it is, in
      part, the reason for having fences (apart from the obvious problem that
      dogs have big mouths, full of pointy teeth, and can bite fairly hard).
      True story: on the third day of living in our house, our next-door
      neighbor wrote and deposited a letter in our mailbox, informing us of our
      dog's ill behavior of barking incessantly. He threatened us with legal
      action if we didn't rectify the barking situation immediately.
      <br/><br/>
      Frustrated, but ultimately on the wrong side of the law, we decided to
      install a dog door, so that Bailey could go outside to evacuate, but could
      remain inside. As we had hoped, our house proved to be sufficient in
      deadening her barking that we received no further complaints.
      <br/><br/>
      The point I'm trying to emphasize here is that, as dog owners, we are
      implictly responsible to our neighbors. We have a duty and an obligation
      to ensure that our dog doesn't pollute their air space with her barking,
      doesn't pollute their yards with her poop, and is properly fenced in lest
      she run out and bite someone.
      <br/><br/>
      And now we've come to it. My dog is not the point of this post. Your cat
      is.
      <br/><br/>
      Sure. Cats are funny. Cats are cute, sometimes. GIFs of cats are
      especially great. The problem is, however, cats are much more of a
      nuisance than they are a benefit to urban society. To be clear, I'm
      speaking of "outdoor" cats.
      <br/><br/>
      As a dog owner, I have an implicit responsibility to my neighborhood. Not
      so for cat owners, whose wards tend to spend as much time shitting in my
      garden and destroying my plants as they do in their owners yards.
      <br/><br/>
      <span class='pull-quote'>Point blank, it is fucking disgusting to have to dig your cats' shit out
      of our garden beds. In fact, it's hard to believe it's even legal for you
      to have a cat in the city.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they shit in their owners' houses,
      apartments, duplexes, and condos. Outdoor cats shit in my yard.
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they chew up their owners' house plants,
      which their owners are responsible for replacing. Outdoor cats chew up my
      fucking garden plants, and I am responsible for replacing them.
      <br/><br/>
      Indoor cats are cool, because they kill nothing, save the catnip rodent
      toy they love to hunt after and murder, each day, endlessly, like some
      kind of Matrix-come-to-life. Outdoor cats kill animals and leave them in
      my yard, as if in some kind of tribute to my generosity for letting them
      hunt my land.
      <br/><br/>
      The bottom line here is that if you own a cat, and let it roam the
      outdoors in an urban environment, you are being a dick. Straight up. You
      are not taking responsiblity for an animal that doesn't give a turd for
      its actions, and will take what it wants, from whom it wants, and will
      shit on that person after the fact.
      <br/><br/>
      If I haven't been clear thus far, let me be so: I don't hate cats. I just
      hate your cats, in my yard. But, because it's a cat and not a dog, it gets
      some sort of societal pass to do whatever the fuck it pleases.
      <br/><br/>
      If you own an outdoor cat, do yourself a favor, and go ask your neighbors
      how it pleases them to pick up cat poop from their yards. Ask them how
      many plants they've had to replace. Ask them what they did with the dead
      rodents found in their yard, adorning the Japanese Maple to which they so
      lovingly tend.
      <br/><br/>
      Ask them that, then ask yourself if your cat shouldn't be wearing a shock
      collar that strongly encourages it to not leave your yard.
      <br/><br/>
      I take care of my pet, and I protect her from doing stupid shit around the
      neighborhood. It's high time cat owners do the same.
