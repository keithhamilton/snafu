      <div id='headline'>AS HIS EYES ADJUSTED TO THE NEAR DARKNESS</div>
    </div>

    <div id='body-text'>
      <span style='font-weight: 700;background-color: #ffdc0d'>After his eyes adjusted to the near blackness
      he managed to find his house shoes.</span> Worn as they were, they still managed
      to provide some decent level of comfort. He could have resolved the issue
      of his cold floors by having the house properly insulated, but he never
      found it easy to part with money, more so when that meant parting with
      thousands of dollars, and especially when his pair of slippers, worn as
      they were, cost him a paltry $75 and had so far lasted him four winters.
      <br/><br/>
      He made his way to the kitchen, where, the sole embodiment of activity at
      that early hour (which was what he felt to be the only time he could
      really think during the day), he perused his usual first-thing-AM haunts.
      Social media feeds, news sites, all projecting a false sense of warmth
      into the otherwise dark kitchen. They didn't offer him too much in the
      form of entertainment—not anymore—but he nonetheless stuck to them as part
      of his morning ritual. It helped him, reset.
      <br/><br/>
      More of the same political nonsense on Stateside. More of the same
      political nonsense on Feedlink. Every now and then a gem surfaced in the
      form of a GIF (which he pronounced "griff" for some reason escaping even
      him), paired with a quote or snippet of text that, although mismatched,
      made for an occasional, if shallow, laugh.
      <br/><br/>
      <span style='font-weight: 700; background-color: #ffdc0d'>What there was to truly laugh about anymore, he could no longer reason.</span>
      <br/><br/>
      "Beep, beep, beep," the stimulat machine called to him from his nearly
      unbreakable fascination with his Sitescan feed. He may as well have been a
      disadvantaged sea critter, in a sea of black, staring into the glowing orb
      of an angler fish, not aware in the least that he was about to be
      swallowed whole.
      <br/><br/>
      "Beep, beep, beep," the stimulat machine called to him like the chiming of
      a lighthouse fixed on his position as he, captain of an oil tanker,
      hopelessly drifted toward the shallow bedrock. He knew it was too late to
      turn about; that his crew would not survive the frigid sea.
      "Beep, beep, beep," the stimulat machine called one last time, as the
      final utterance of a long-dead companion, whose final consolation was a
      fading memory, one that he knew instinctually he needed to hold on to.
      <br/><br/>
      Hold on.
      <br/><br/>
      Look up. Shut off feed. Pour coffee. Wake the fuck up. A routine that
      defined him as much as it did his morning.
      It was his program. And he had work to do.
